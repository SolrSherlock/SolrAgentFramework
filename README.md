Status: *pre-alpha*<br/>
Latest edit: 20130213
## Background ##
SolrAgentFramework serves as a *host* for plug in agents which perform tasks associated with processing information resources structured as Solr documents.

The framework provides two different APIs to the agents installed in it:
- TCP access to the SolrAgentCoordinator blackboard
- Network access to the Solr installation which contains all the documents the agents manipulate

## ToDo ##
Mavenize the project<br/>
Create a full unit test suite
